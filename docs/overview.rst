About the Dynamic Suite
=======================
Previously known as the "Employee Suite", the Dynamic Suite sets out
to create an easy to understand and lightweight PHP web framework for
login-only applications. Started originally as a project to bring
employee scheduling and management into the modern age of the web,
it has expanded to include a module API toolkit for various applications
that can be applied across many industries.

Originally proprietary software, it was released in early 2016 by
Simplusoft LLC under the GNU GPLv2 license, open source, and free!

Commercial Support
==================
Simplusoft LLC offers a variety of proprietary commercial modules for
the workplace, including delivery routing, employee scheduling, and
inventory & management. Simplusoft also offers paid hosting and support
for instances of the Dynamic Suite.
