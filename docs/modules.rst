Module Structure
================
Modules are directories within the **module** directory with a specific name and
configuration file.

Each module must contain a JSON file with configuration settings to structure the module.

Here is an example configuration::

  {
    "my-module" : {
      "name"    : "My Module",
      "version" : "1.0",
      "author"  : "Simplusoft LLC",
      "about"   : "This is an example module",
      "perm"    : "my_permission",
      "active"  : true,
      "icon"    : "fa-calendar",
      "css" : {
        "0" : "/path/to/css/main.css"
      },
      "js" : {
        "0" : "/path/to/js/client-side.js"
      },
      "include" : {
        "0" : "/path/to/included/server.inc.php"
      },
      "content" : {
        "some-page" : {
          "name"    : "Some Page",
          "perm"    : "my_page_permission",
          "active"  : true,
          "icon"    : "fa-info",
          "content" : {
            "some-tab" : {
              "name"    : "Some Tab",
              "perm"    : "my_tab_permission",
              "active"  : true,
              "content" : "/modules/my-module/pages/main.php"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
